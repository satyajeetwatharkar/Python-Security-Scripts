Lets 
see how
multiline comments work

x=5 #how cool is it, no need to assign any type just assign

x=int(3) #Ulta Java
# Variable
"""
DOnt have to declare type while intializing, can cast using 

x=str(5)
x=int(4)


type() will give the type of variable
double quote and single quotes are same
Variable names are case sensitive
Var name must start with letter or underscore
cannot start with no
only apla numeric or underscore

Can assign val to multiple variables at a time
