# Python Security Scripts 🐍🔐

This repository contains my 30-day journey to learn Python for cybersecurity and security automation.  
Each day I write and upload a new script focused on topics like:
- Reconnaissance (port scanning, DNS lookups)
- Web security automation (parameter fuzzing, IDOR detection)
- Security APIs (VirusTotal, Shodan)
- System & network scripting

## 📅 Roadmap
| Week | Focus Area |
|------|-------------|
| Week 1 | Python basics, automation |
| Week 2 | Networking & Recon |
| Week 3 | Web Security Automation |
| Week 4 | APIs, Advanced Automation |

## 🧰 Tools & Setup
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `paramiko`, `dnspython`, `psutil`
- Use only on authorized targets. Lab-only automation.

## 🧠 Learning Goal
Build 30+ scripts to showcase in my cybersecurity resume and demonstrate automation skills.
